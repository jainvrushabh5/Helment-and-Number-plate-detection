 # Helment And Number Plate Detection
The Helmet and License Plate Detection System is an object detection project designed to identify helmets, license plates, and motorcyclists in images. It was developed using YOLOv8 for helmets and motorcyclists, while a different model was used for license plate detection due to performance issues. The system was trained on a custom dataset of 681 images and achieved a strong performance, with an overall mAP50 of 0.876. Performance metrics were visualized using Weights & Biases.
